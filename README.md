### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: How to inspire people during a recession
+ This project is conducted by Yaqin Li.

+ Project summary: [a short summary] In the midst of layoffs, pay cuts, and tight budgets, people's morale and loyalty is stretched to its limits. During this period, presidents' inaugural speech shoulder the responsibility of giving people hope and warming people's heart. At the same time, the speech also build up a basis for policies in the future. Thus, using text mining, I want to find out if there is any skills we can learn from inaugural speeches about how to motivate people in a recession.
